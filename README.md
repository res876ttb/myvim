# My vim configuration

## Installation

Via curl:
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/res876ttb/myvim/master/install.sh)"
```

Via wget:
```shell
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/res876ttb/myvim/master/install.sh -O -)"
```

==NOTE==: The provided one-line installation command will clone the myvim from github to `~/.myvim`. DO NOT remove this directory because the `.vimrc` is just a symbolic link from `$HOME/.vimrc` to `$HOME/.myvim/.vimrc`.
